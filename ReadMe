This program takes in the closing stock price for the last year using Yahoo finance data. It creates an 
Excel spreadsheet with the data, and prints a time-series plot of the data.
I chose AAPL as a sample case, but the code can easily be modified to collect data on other stocks
by changing the input URLs.
